        Which Triangle?
A triangle has 3 sides. A Triangle type is determined by its sides:

All sides equal is called, Equilateral Triangle.
Two sides equal is called, Isosceles Triangle.
All sides different is called, Scalene Triangle.
Take the sides of a triangle as input and write a program to determine the triangle type. Change the inputs everytime manually to see if the output changes correctly.
